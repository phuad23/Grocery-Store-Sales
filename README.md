# Grocery-Store-Sales-SQL
This project focuses on analyzing of FoodYum which is a grocery store chain that is based in the United States.
Food Yum sells items such as produce, meat, dairy, baked goods, snacks, and other household food staples.

### Project Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning and Validation:** I performed a column-by-column inspection of the data, cleaned it by imputing missing values and correcting inconsistencies.
2. **Analysing of Minimum and Maximum price of stock:** I calculated for the Minimum and Maximum values of each products.
3. **Identifying products with Average unit sold:** I calculated for the products with Average unit sold that is greater than 10.

Conclusively, I leveraged my data analytics skills to identify products with atleast average unit sold of 10 or more, allowing the store to know which product is selling more.
